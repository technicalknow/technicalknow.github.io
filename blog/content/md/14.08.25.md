**Secure Your Files Like Mr. Robot: Encrypt with OpenSSL on Linux**
*August 11, 2025 — Technical Know*

### Introduction

If you keep sensitive documents, personal photos, or confidential work files on your computer, privacy should be your top priority. Simply hiding files isn’t enough—anyone with basic know‑how can uncover them in seconds.

The real solution? **Encryption.**
In this guide, you’ll learn how to easily **protect your files and folders using OpenSSL**—so your data remains yours, no matter what happens to your device.

### Why Hiding Isn’t Enough

On Linux, you can hide a file by renaming it with a dot at the start (e.g., `.file.txt`). But with just one command (`ls -a`), those “hidden” files can be revealed.

Encryption changes the game—turning your readable data into an unreadable stream of random characters unless someone has **both** your password and the correct encryption method.

### What is OpenSSL?

OpenSSL is a widely trusted, open-source encryption toolkit built into most Linux systems. It’s versatile, reliable, and incredibly powerful—used everywhere from securing websites to encrypting private data.

### Encrypting a File in 3 Steps

**1. Create Your File**

```bash
touch file2.txt
echo "Hello. This is a private file and the data is secured." > file2.txt
```

**2. Encrypt With AES‑256‑CBC**

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file2.txt -out file2.txt.enc
```

- **aes-256-cbc** → A strong encryption method.
- **-salt** → Adds extra protection.
- **-in** → Input file.
- **-out** → Output (encrypted) file.

Enter a strong password when prompted.

**3. Verify**
Open `file2.txt.enc`—you’ll see nothing but random symbols. That’s your file… locked away.

***

### Decrypting the File

To unlock it:

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in file2.txt.enc -out file2_decrypted.txt
```

- **-d** decrypts the file.
- Use the same password you encrypted it with. Otherwise—garbage output.

***

### Encrypting Entire Folders

OpenSSL can’t encrypt folders directly, but you can **archive and encrypt** them.

**1. Compress the Folder**

```bash
tar -cvf secret_folder.tar myfiles/
```

**2. Encrypt the Archive**

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in secret_folder.tar -out topsecret.html
```

*(Yes, you can disguise it with any file extension—even `.html`.)*

**3. Decrypt \& Extract**

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in topsecret.html -out decrypted_folder.tar
tar -xvf decrypted_folder.tar
```

### Pro Tips for Maximum Security

- **Double-layer protection:** Encrypt files individually before compressing, then encrypt the archive too.
- **Password-protected zip:** Adding a password to the zip file increases difficulty for attackers.

***

### Why Encryption is Worth It

Even if someone steals your storage device or copies your files, encryption ensures they remain unreadable without the right password.

It’s not just about secrecy—it’s about control. You decide who can see your data.

***

**Final Thoughts**
With OpenSSL, securing your data is just a matter of a few commands. You can defend single files or entire folders, making your information useless to anyone who doesn’t have the key.

So, don’t just hide your files… **encrypt them.**
