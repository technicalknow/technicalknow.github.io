**How it works:**
- Open a terminal in the directory you want to share.
- Run this command:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server 1111
    ```
    - `1111` is the port; you can choose any free one.

**Benefits:**
- Any device on your Wi-Fi network (laptop, phone, tablet) can access this folder via a browser.
- Just type:  
  `http://<your-computer-ip>:1111` in the browser (same network required).

**Use case:**  
Stream videos, download PDFs, or grab documents straight from any Wi-Fi device—no cable needed!


## Method 2: Secure File Transfer with FTP Server

FTP remains a classic for secure, authenticated sharing between computers and phones.

    ```
    ftp://192.168.1.5:1024
    ```

- Browse folders remotely, upload/download files bi-directionally.
