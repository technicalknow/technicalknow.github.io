# Hide your secret files from everyone

Steghide is a command-line steganography tool that hides arbitrary secret files inside cover files such as JPEG, BMP, WAV, or AU. It compresses the secret data, optionally encrypts it (default: **AES-128-CBC**), embeds a checksum for integrity, and selects embedding positions pseudo-randomly based on a passphrase so the cover’s first-order statistics remain unchanged.



## Key features (short)
- **Supports JPEG, BMP, WAV, AU** cover formats.  
- **Compression + encryption + CRC32 integrity** for embedded data.  
- **Passphrase-derived pseudo-random embedding** (positions depend on passphrase).  
- Default encryption: **rijndael-128 (AES) in CBC mode**.  
- CLI tool; stable release around 0.5.1.



## Installation

On Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install steghide
```

On Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install steghide
```

On macOS (Homebrew):
```
brew install steghide
```

If your distribution lacks a package, compile from source (requires libmhash, libmcrypt).



## Basic workflow and important commands

Display help / version / encinfo:
```
steghide --help
steghide --version
steghide --encinfo      # lists available encryption algorithms and modes
```

Check info about a cover/stego file:
```
steghide --info cover.jpg
```
This shows whether a file contains embedded data (if stego) or what capacity it has.

Embed (hide) a file into a cover:
```
steghide embed -cf cover.jpg -ef secret.pdf -sf output.jpg
```
- If -sf omitted, steghide will modify the cover in place.  
- You will be prompted for a passphrase (used to derive embedding PRNG and encryption key).

Embed with explicit compression and encryption options:
```
steghide embed -cf song.wav -ef secret.zip -sf song_stego.wav -z 9 -e rijndael-256 ofb
```
- -z sets compression level (1..9).  
- -e sets encryption algorithm and/or mode; use --encinfo to view supported names.  
- Use `-e none` to disable encryption (not recommended).

Embed reading secret from stdin or writing stego to stdout:
```
cat secret.txt | steghide embed -cf cover.bmp -ef - -sf out.bmp
steghide embed -cf - -ef secret.txt -sf out.jpg < cover.jpg
```

Extract (retrieve) embedded file:
```
steghide extract -sf output.jpg
```
- You'll be prompted for the passphrase. By default it restores the original embedded filename into the current directory.  
- To extract to a specific filename or from stdin use options (-xf for filename; read/write via '-').

Example: extract and specify output name:
```
steghide extract -sf song_stego.wav -xf secret_extracted.zip
```

List supported encryption algorithms/modes:
```
steghide --encinfo
```

Display license:
```
steghide --license
```



## Practical examples

Hide a text note inside a JPEG:
```
steghide embed -cf photo.jpg -ef note.txt -sf photo_secret.jpg
# enter passphrase when prompted
```

Hide a folder (archive it first) inside an audio file:
```
zip -r secrets.zip my_secret_folder
steghide embed -cf podcast.wav -ef secrets.zip -sf podcast_stego.wav
```

Extract the archive later:
```
steghide extract -sf podcast_stego.wav
# enter passphrase, then unzip the restored secrets.zip
```

Use stronger AES-256 (if available in encinfo) and max compression:
```
steghide embed -cf cover.jpg -ef top_secret.pdf -sf cover_stego.jpg -z 9 -e rijndael-256 cbc
```

Disable encryption but keep compression:
```
steghide embed -cf cover.bmp -ef payload.bin -sf cover_stego.bmp -e none -z 6
```



## Tips, limitations, and security notes

- Steghide is not actively maintained frequently; the last widely-distributed stable release is 0.5.1. Use with caution on modern systems and check package reputation.  
- Embedding capacity depends on cover file format and size; always run `steghide --info coverfile` to check capacity.  
- Even though embedding resists first-order statistical detection, advanced steganalysis tools may detect anomalies—do not treat steghide as perfect stealth.  
- Always use a strong passphrase; steghide’s security depends on passphrase strength and the chosen encryption algorithm.  
- Keep backups of original cover files; steghide can overwrite the cover if -sf omitted.  
- For legal/ethical use only.
